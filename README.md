If you're at least in your forties and ever owned an IBM, Tandy, Amiga, or Atari ST… If you still remember the difference 
between CGA, EGA, and VGA graphics cards... You might have heard of *Lost Dutchman Mine*, a game published in 1989 by Magnetic
Images.

And if none of that rings a bell—but you’re drawn to playing poker, digging for gold, eating fried rattlesnakes, or chasing
wanted outlaws across blazing deserts while fending off thirst, hunger, and hostile encounters—then you’re absolutely in 
the right place.

At Niner Games, we adore that wild frontier vibe and the legendary Lost Dutchman Mine. We’ve decided to revive, reimagine, 
and reboot this beautiful classic—one of the earliest survival games in the history of gaming.
